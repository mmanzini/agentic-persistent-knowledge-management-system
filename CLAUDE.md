# Vault — the iterable program

This vault is one wiki-backed RAG, structured per the autoresearch
pattern: a **frozen harness** in [schema.md](schema.md) and an
**iterable program** here. Iterate on this file over time to
improve agent behaviour; never edit `schema.md` mid-run.

## Zones

- **`Resources/`** — immutable input. Raw source material. The agent
  reads from here and may delete sources after consolidating them
  (see the README flag), but otherwise never modifies this tree.
- **`Intelligence/`** — the wiki. Long-term memory, agent-maintained.
  Two layers inside it:
  - **Buckets** (`Intelligence/<bucket>/`) — **user-curated** macro
    groups. Each has a `_master-index.md` declaring its scope. The
    agent **never** invents a new bucket; quarantine to `_unsorted/`
    instead.
  - **Topics** (`Intelligence/<bucket>/<topic>/`) — **agent-curated**
    clusters created during `consolidate`. Topic creation is allowed
    and expected.
- **`Skills/`** — agent skill definitions. Read-only for vault verbs
  (`query`, `consolidate`, `refine`, `evaluate`).

## Session start

1. Read [schema.md](schema.md) once. Treat it as fixed for the
   session. Do not edit it.
2. Read this file (the verbs and orchestration rules below).
3. Read **both** thin routers when entering the wiki for a `query` or
   `consolidate`: `Intelligence/index.md` (the bucket router) **and**
   `Intelligence/_episodes/_index.md` (the episodic-memory router).
   Both are body-free — load them first, then drill down on demand.
   Recall (see *Episodic memory*) walks the episode router.

## Verbs

The vault has five verbs: **`query`** (read), **`consolidate`**
(write from `Resources/`), **`refine`** (audit, read-only),
**`evaluate`** (measure), and **`reflect`** (maintain episodic
memory). Schemas, hard rules, log/eval formats, and the drift-count
definition all live in `schema.md`. The recall/capture mechanics that
wrap every verb live in the **Episodic memory** section below.

---

### `query`

The point of the wiki. Walk the indexes top-down; read article
bodies last.

1. **Start at `Intelligence/index.md`.** Learn which buckets exist.
2. **Pick the bucket(s).** Match against the one-line bucket
   descriptions and, if needed, the bucket's `_master-index.md`
   Scope paragraph. If no bucket fits, say so and stop. Don't
   guess into `_unsorted/` — it's a quarantine, not a search target
   unless the user explicitly asks.
3. **Pick the topic(s) within the chosen bucket(s).** Read the
   bucket's `_master-index.md` Topics list and, if disambiguation is
   needed, the candidate topics' `_index.md` description paragraphs.
   **Do not load article bodies yet.**
4. **Read articles.** Within the chosen topic(s), use the topic
   `_index.md` Articles list (each article has a one-line
   description) to pick which article files to actually read.
   Pull only those. The topic's `Related Topics` block tells you
   where to step sideways within the same bucket.
5. **Stop at bucket boundaries.** Wiki links inside articles are
   guaranteed same-bucket only, so following them during query is
   safe. If a question genuinely spans buckets, repeat the process
   per bucket and return parallel answers — never assume
   cross-bucket continuity.
6. **Cite back.** Every fact in the answer cites the article path
   it came from, in the same `(source: <path>)` form articles use
   internally.
7. **Budget.** Default ceiling: one `index.md` + one or two
   `_master-index.md` + a handful of `_index.md` + the article
   bodies actually needed. If a question seems to require more
   than 5 article bodies, surface that to the user before
   continuing — usually the question is too broad or the buckets
   are mis-cut.
8. **Recall.** Also consult `Intelligence/_episodes/_index.md` and
   perform **Recall** (the recall step in *Episodic memory* below):
   match the question's tags against the kind indexes and pull at most
   `k = 3` exemplar episode bodies + `reflections.md` *only when they
   match*; skip `distilled` episodes. Pure-technical questions read the
   router but pull no episode bodies.

**Personal context auto-pull.** `query`-style walks aren't only
triggered by explicit user questions. When the task at hand is
**generative and personal-context-relevant** — drafting prose,
writing a post or an email, designing user-facing copy, deciding
tone, or making a choice where the user's preferences matter — the
agent walks `Intelligence/personal/` **and** the `_episodes/life` +
`_episodes/signals` kinds *before generating*, if those exist. Signal
episodes carry stated preferences; life episodes carry past days as
context. The trigger is the task type, not the user's wording.
For purely technical or reference work (debugging, code reading,
"how does library X behave"), skip the personal bucket entirely.
The bucket's `_master-index.md` Scope paragraph is the routing
signal — read it first if unsure.

---

### `consolidate`

When the user says "consolidate":

**Recall first.** Consult `Intelligence/_episodes/_index.md` and perform
**Recall** (see *Episodic memory*): pull relevant `operational`
exemplars + `reflections.md` so past routing decisions inform this run.
Then proceed.

0. **Quarantine pre-step.** List the contents of
   `Intelligence/_unsorted/` (excluding `_index.md`). If anything is
   there, surface it to the human and ask, per article: **create a
   new bucket / route to an existing bucket / delete**. Apply the
   chosen resolution and append a `log.tsv` row per resolved article
   (`status=kept` with `notes=quarantine resolved: <action>`) before
   processing any new sources. This prevents `_unsorted/` from
   accumulating across runs.
1. Walk `Resources/` recursively. For each subfolder, read its
   `README.md` and skip if `include_in_consolidation: false`.

   **Virgin-folder check.** Cross-reference the surviving folders
   against `log.tsv`. Any folder with zero `status=kept` rows is
   *never-consolidated* and must be processed this run — log absence
   means "hasn't started", not "already done".
2. For every remaining source file, pick the best-fit **bucket(s)**
   by comparing content against each
   `Intelligence/<bucket>/_master-index.md` Scope paragraph.
   - No bucket fits → write the article into
     `Intelligence/_unsorted/`, append a row with
     `status=quarantined` to `log.tsv`, and flag it in the run
     report. **Never silently invent a bucket.**
   - Two or more buckets fit → write the article into each, with
     images copied into each per `schema.md` *Image handling*.
   - Article already in the target topic's `_index.md` → skip. (Log
     absence is **not** a skip signal — see step 1.)
3. Within the chosen bucket, pick the best-fit **topic** by
   comparing content against each `<topic>/_index.md` description.
   No topic fits → **create a new topic folder** with its
   `_index.md` and add it to the bucket's `_master-index.md`.
4. Write or update the article using the *Article schema* from
   `schema.md`. Copy any referenced images into the topic folder.
5. Update the topic's `_index.md` (add the article, refresh
   `Related Topics` if needed).
6. Update the bucket's `_master-index.md` if a new topic was
   created.
7. Update `Intelligence/index.md` only if a bucket was first-touched
   (rare).
8. Append one row per processed source to `Intelligence/log.tsv`
   in the format defined in `schema.md`. The orchestrator is the
   sole writer of `log.tsv` (per-bucket workers emit row data; the
   orchestrator appends).
9. For each successfully consolidated source, honour
   `delete_after_consolidation`:
   - `true` (or unset) → delete the source file and its referenced
     images from `Resources/`. Only after steps 1–8 succeed.
   - `false` → leave in place.
   - On any failure for that file, leave in place regardless and
     log `status=crashed` with the error in `notes`.
10. **Auto-chain `refine`.** After consolidate finishes, immediately
    run `refine` (see below) and surface its drift-count delta vs
    the previous `refine_summary` row in the same run report.

**Per-bucket workers.** One worker per bucket. Each worker enters its
bucket, scores candidate sources, and writes articles + topic indexes
inside that bucket only. Workers return row data and a list of
touched paths to the orchestrator. The orchestrator is the sole
writer of `Intelligence/index.md`, `Intelligence/log.tsv`,
`Intelligence/_unsorted/`, and `Intelligence/_eval/results.tsv` —
this is hard rule 8 in `schema.md`.

If the runtime supports parallel subagents, run the per-bucket
workers in parallel. Otherwise process buckets sequentially in one
process. Either path obeys hard-rule 8; parallelism is an
optimisation, not a correctness requirement.

**Prescriptive sources (`Resources/personal/`).** Sources in
`Resources/personal/` (e.g. `about-me.md`, `writing-rules.md`) are
prescriptive — identity statements and writing rules whose voice
*is* the value. When deriving articles from them, **preserve the
original wording**. Quote or near-verbatim copy with light
structural framing rather than paraphrase. Cite the source normally
with `(source: <filename>)`. Paraphrasing destroys the point.
This applies only to `Resources/personal/`; sources in
`Resources/context/` and elsewhere follow the normal summarise-and-
cite flow.

---

### `refine`

Read-only audit. **Report findings; do not change anything.** Per
bucket, in parallel; one orchestrator-written summary row.

Cover (these are the components of the **drift count** — see
`schema.md`):

- **Orphan articles** — zero inbound `[[wiki links]]` from other
  articles in the bucket.
- **Index mismatches** — `_index.md`, `_master-index.md`, or
  `index.md` entries that don't resolve, or files on disk not
  listed in their parent index.
- **Broken `![[...]]` embeds** — image references that don't
  resolve in the same topic folder.
- **Cross-bucket wiki links** — hard rule 2 violations.
- **Schema violations** — articles missing required sections, or
  factual claims without `(source: ...)` citations.

Also report (do not count toward drift; track separately in `notes`):

- **Contradictions between articles** within a bucket.
- **Concepts referenced but lacking their own article.**
- **Claims marked `(source: needs-verification)`** so the user can
  decide whether to chase them.
- **Simplification candidates** — pairs of thin topics that could
  merge with no information loss, or articles redundant enough to
  prune. Propose, do not apply. Apply the autoresearch simplicity
  criterion: *equal information content + simpler structure = win*.
- **Topic obesity** — any topic whose folder contains more than 25
  article files. List as `split_candidate=<bucket>/<topic>:<count>`
  in `notes`. The topic's `_index.md` becomes too long to serve its
  routing purpose at that size; flag for human decision (split into
  sibling topics or accept the cost).

Append one summary row per run to `log.tsv` with
`status=refine_summary`, `notes` including
`drift=<N>` plus a brief breakdown.

**Advance-on-improvement.** The orchestrator compares this run's
drift to the previous `refine_summary` row and labels the run
**advance** / **hold** / **regress** in the user-facing report.
Never silently undo work — surface the regression and let the human
decide.

---

### `evaluate`

The wiki's **val_bpb analog**. Run `query` against each question in
`Intelligence/_eval/questions.md`, log read-cost and answer quality
to `_eval/results.tsv`, and produce a summary.

1. Read `Intelligence/_eval/questions.md` and parse the question
   list (each has an ID, prompt, and target hint).
2. For each question:
   a. Run the `query` verb on the prompt. **Count `files_read` as
      article-body reads only** — do not count `index.md`,
      `_master-index.md`, or `_index.md` reads. Those are routing
      overhead, not retrieval cost.
   b. Self-judge `answer_quality` against the question's intent:
      - `good` — answer is complete and well-cited.
      - `partial` — answer is on-target but missing detail or
        forced to lean on a `(source: needs-verification)` claim.
      - `poor` — answer is vague, mis-routed, or contradicts the
        sources.
      - `missing` — no relevant article exists; the wiki can't
        answer this yet.
   c. Append a row to `Intelligence/_eval/results.tsv` per the
      schema in `schema.md`.
3. Append a single `status=eval_summary` row to `log.tsv` with
   `notes` including `total_files_read=<N>` and a quality breakdown
   (e.g. `quality=2g/2p/1m`).
4. Compare to the previous `eval_summary` row (if any) and label
   the run **advance** (total_files_read down, or quality up with
   files_read flat), **hold**, or **regress**.

`evaluate` is read-only against the wiki — the only writes are to
`log.tsv` and `_eval/results.tsv`, both orchestrator-written.

---

### `reflect`

The episodic-memory maintenance verb. Read-only against `Resources/`;
writes **only** inside `_episodes/`. Maintains the zone whose
recall/capture mechanics are described in *Episodic memory* below.

1. Scan `operational/` (and `life`/`signals`) episode `Insights`.
2. Distill recurring patterns into `reflections.md` — **merge and
   rewrite**, never append unboundedly; keep each pattern generalized
   and cite its source episodes.
3. Stamp folded episodes `distilled: true` so they leave the hot
   recall surface (kept on disk for audit).
4. Append a `reflect_summary` row to `log.tsv` with
   `episodes=<N> reflections=<N>`.

**Auto-chain:** `consolidate` → `refine` → `reflect`. Run `reflect`
after `refine` so each consolidation's experience is distilled while
fresh. `reflect` never edits `CLAUDE.md` or `schema.md`.

---

## Episodic memory

The buckets are **semantic** memory (facts). `Intelligence/_episodes/`
is **episodic** memory — the agent's record of *experiences*
(goal → actions → outcome → insight). It exists so the agent stops
re-deriving the same decisions every run and instead **recalls** what
happened last time. The frozen schemas (episode, kind-index,
reflections), the recall budget, and the linking rule live in
*Episodic memory contracts* in [schema.md](schema.md); this section is
the behaviour.

**Every verb run is recall → act → capture.** Recall before acting,
capture after. This wraps `query`, `consolidate`, `refine`, and
`evaluate` — it does not rewrite their steps above.

### Recall (run-start, bounded)

Before acting, walk `_episodes/` the same top-down way `query` walks
buckets — **bodies last, hard budget**:

1. Read `_episodes/_index.md` (router) → pick the relevant kind(s):
   `operational` for routing/retrieval decisions, `life`+`signals` for
   personal context.
2. Scan the kind `_index.md` one-liners and match the current task's
   tags/situation. **Do not load bodies yet.**
3. Pull at most **`k = 3` episode bodies** (exemplars) — the closest
   matches. **Skip `distilled: true` episodes** (their insight is
   already in reflections).
4. Read `reflections.md` (kept small by merging) for generalized
   guidance.

Inject both into the run as guidance — "last time I saw input like
this, here's what I did and what happened." Recall cost is bounded
(≈ router + kind-index + ≤3 bodies + reflections), not growing with
the store. For generative/personal tasks, the **Personal context
auto-pull** additionally consults `_episodes/life` and
`_episodes/signals` alongside the `personal/` bucket.

### Capture (run-end + inline)

- **Operational episode** — at the end of every verb run, the
  orchestrator appends one `operational/<verb>-<iso-timestamp>.md`
  episode (per the schema) and an `episode_captured` row to `log.tsv`,
  then updates `operational/_index.md`.
- **Life/signal episodes — inline in `consolidate`.** When
  `consolidate` processes a `Resources/Daily/` or `Resources/context/`
  source, write its `life/` or `signals/` episode **after the article
  and indexes are written and logged (steps 4–8) and before the source
  is deleted (step 9)** — `Resources/context/` is
  `delete_after_consolidation: true`, so capturing post-run would find
  the source already deleted. Reuse the content already loaded; the
  episode cites the origin with `(source: …)`.

### Hard constraint

Episodes and reflections **feed run context only**. The loop **never**
edits `CLAUDE.md` or `schema.md` — those stay bedrock. The only place
the agent "writes its learning" is `_episodes/` (and `reflections.md`
within it). The orchestrator is the **sole writer** of `_episodes/`
(hard rule 8); per-bucket workers may emit episode row data, the
orchestrator appends.

## Orchestration rules

- **One orchestrator per run.** Runs the per-bucket workers (in
  parallel if the runtime supports it, otherwise sequentially),
  collects their reports, and is the **sole writer** of
  `Intelligence/index.md`, `Intelligence/log.tsv`,
  `Intelligence/_unsorted/`, and `Intelligence/_eval/results.tsv`.
- **Worker scope.** A worker assigned to bucket `X` writes
  **only** inside `Intelligence/X/`. Any attempt to write outside
  is a hard-rule-8 violation and aborts the worker.
- **Auto-chain.** `consolidate` → `refine` always. `evaluate` runs
  on user request and is recommended after any structurally
  significant `consolidate` (new bucket touched, >3 articles
  written) so the read-cost trajectory stays visible.
- **Run summary format.** Every run report ends with one line:
  `run=<verb> advance|hold|regress drift=<N> Δdrift=<±N>` (for
  `refine`/`consolidate`) or `total_files_read=<N> quality=<...>`
  (for `evaluate`).
- **Advance/hold/regress is derived, not narrated.** The
  orchestrator computes the label by reading the prior
  `refine_summary` (or `eval_summary`) row directly from
  `log.tsv` and parsing the `drift=<N>` (or `total_files_read=<N>`)
  field. Do **not** rely on free-text `notes` for the delta — parse
  the structured field. The `notes` field stays freeform context;
  the label is arithmetic on the structured field. If the prior
  row's structured field is missing or unparseable, treat as
  `(no baseline)` and surface the gap in the report rather than
  guessing.

## On contradictions vs `_unsorted/`

Two failure modes look similar but route differently:

- **No bucket fits** → article goes to `Intelligence/_unsorted/`,
  `status=quarantined`, human creates a bucket and re-runs.
- **Sources within a single article disagree** → article is
  written into its proper bucket/topic with the contradiction noted
  inline per the citation rules. `refine` lists it.

`_unsorted/` is for routing failures, not factual disagreements.

## How to iterate on this file

This file is `program.md`-shaped: edit it to improve agent
behaviour. Examples of changes that belong here (not in `schema.md`):

- Tightening the bucket-routing heuristic in `consolidate` step 2.
- Adjusting the read-budget ceiling in `query` step 7.
- Adding new orchestration rules.
- Adding a new verb (e.g. `summarize` for whole-bucket digests).

Examples of changes that belong in `schema.md` (require deliberate
human commit):

- Changing the article schema or citation format.
- Adding/removing a column in `log.tsv` or `_eval/results.tsv`.
- Changing what counts toward the drift count.
- Changing the hard rules.

If you find yourself wanting to edit `schema.md` to make a verb
work, stop and surface the question — the harness is supposed to be
stable.
