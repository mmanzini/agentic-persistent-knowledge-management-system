## Summary

A bad abstraction is paid for every time a reader has to unwind it,
while three duplicated lines are paid for once when someone unifies
them. The right default is to wait for the third occurrence before
abstracting.

## The argument

Each abstraction adds a layer of indirection that every future reader
must traverse. If the abstraction's shape doesn't match the next use
case, callers either branch the abstraction or work around it — both
of which compound the cost (source: clipping-two.md).

The author quotes Sandi Metz: *"duplication is far cheaper than the
wrong abstraction"* (source: clipping-two.md). The implication is
that DRY-at-all-costs is a heuristic past its useful range; the
correct rule is "abstract when you have three concrete cases that
share a shape," not "abstract whenever you see two similar things."

## The inverse failure

The piece notes the inverse failure mode — refusing to abstract
genuinely repeated logic — but argues it is rarer in codebases
written by experienced engineers (source: clipping-two.md). No data
is offered for that "rarer" claim (source: needs-verification).

## Key Takeaways

- The cost of a bad abstraction recurs on every read; the cost of duplication is paid once on unification (source: clipping-two.md).
- "Wait for the third case" is a more useful rule than "DRY everything" (source: clipping-two.md).
- The inverse failure exists but is claimed (without evidence) to be rarer.
